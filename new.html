  <h1>Healthcare is a Human Right.</h1>
  <p><b>HEADS UP</b>: you may need to tap the three dots button at the top right and select <b>Open in browser</b> for the email button to work (actively working on a fix for this).</p>
  
  <button class="button" id="emailButton">Tap here to email your elected officials to encourage healthcare reform with one click</button>
  <p class="footer"><em>Feel free to edit if you wish, but <b>don't forget to tap send!</b></em></p>

  <p class="highlight">This project is in its infancy. Features to come include directly writing your state and US representatives, as well as members of local government.</p>
  <p class="highlight" style="font-weight: normal; color: #333; margin-top: 10px;">In the meantime, please follow and do your best to help the cause elsewhere! Thank you.</p>
  <p class="footer" style="font-size: 12px; color: #666;">ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ I should probably include that this is for United States citizens and writing letters to elected officials is probably best left to constituents. But what do I know? The internet is free, do what you want.</p>
